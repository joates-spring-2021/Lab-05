# Lab-05 - Dictionaries

Now our labs will begin to get a little more interesting. This lab focuses on using dictionaries, but it will include many other elements.  Some will be done for you, but you will be responsible for the majority of the logic.

# Requirements

A common element seen on web pages these days are [tag clouds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud). A tag cloud is a visual representation of frequency of words, where more frequent words are represented in larger font. One can also use colors and placement.

We are going to analyze the 2012 presidential debate transcript and create a dictionary that can be used for a tag cloud for each candidate of the words they used, where the frequency of the words indicates the size of the font in the cloud. We will focus only on organizing the data and not dipictingi the tag cloud itself at this time.
